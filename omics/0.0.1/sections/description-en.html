<span class="markdown">
The classes of this ontology describe specific parts of the hypothesis that we create. For example, if we ask DISK "Is NACA2 gene associated with Colon Cancer?" it will use the ontology to determine NACA2 as an instance of Gene and Colon Cancer as an instance of a Cancer (see figure below for a real example from DISK). DISK can then use this information to identify a hypothesis pattern, trigger a line of inquiry that matches the classes used (gene, cancer protein, etc.), and execute workflows to support or refute the hypothesis. </span>
